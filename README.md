### Graceful Degradation:
It is a strategy where web applications syart with all functionalities enabled but remain usable when newer technologies fail/ aren't present. Service workers enhance this concept by allowing websites to function offline or with poor network conditions. They serve cached assets and intercept network requests thus providing fallback for when certain fetures like online data retrieval are not available. This way service workers help ensure that if modern browser features fail/get removed the application can still provide its core functionalilty.
